# Monstercat Connect Frontend

This project contains the client that connects to the Monstercat API to manage
our data. We have opened this project to let others help contribute and fix
issues. We will reward those that help fix critical bugs, implement features,
and find security issues.

## Technology Involved

The following pieces of software are involved in creation of the client:

* CoffeeScript
* Jade
* Marked
* Less
* Component
* Myth

Even though we use less, we tend to stay away from it for simplicity reasons.

Component is an old tool we used to create modules on the frontend. We continue
to use it due to the large code base we have already established on top of it.
